# Chapter 4 Study Guide

Light microscope - uses light and glass lenses to magnify any image.
SEM microscope - “Scanning electron microscope” used to study cell surfaces.
TEM microscope - “Transmission electron microscope” used to study internal cell structures.
Surface-to-volume ratio - The ratio of a cell to see how much of an adequate exchange will add with an environment.
They are carried out by proteins.
Membrane proteins, “Integrins” connect to microfilaments of the cytoskeleton.
All cells have a cell membrane.
.
Eukaryotic
Prokaryotic
All cells have a cell membrane, plasma membrane, chromosomes, and ribosomes.
Prokaryotic cells have - Ribosomes, they are unicellular meaning there’s no true nucleus, DNA is in nucleoid region, most have a cell wall, no membrane bounded organelles, and Flagella are prokaryotic cells that are sperm and found mainly in men for humans.
Eukaryotic cells have - Nucleus with a membrane, subcellular structures, and is where the cellular metabolism occurs.
.
Nucleus - contains DNA, chromosomes, and nuclear membrane. 
Nuclear envelope (membrane) - is the double lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds the genetic material.
Nucleolus - is the nuclear subdomain that assembles ribosomal subunits in eukaryotic cells.
Cytoplasm - thick solution that fills each cell and is enclosed by the cell membrane. 
Ribosomes - responsible for production of protein in all living cells.
Endoplasmic reticulum - network of membranous tubules within the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell, continuous with the nuclear membrane.
Smooth - (no ribosomes attached to it) functions is the synthesis of lipids, detoxification, storage of calcium ions.
Rough - (ribosomes attached to it) Production of proteins and membranes for transport of molecules.
Golgi apparatus - packaging and modification center. receives and modifies substances from the endoplasmic reticulum and then ships them out. 
Lysosomes - contains digestive proteins (enzymes). Recycling center - to remove or recycle damaged parts of the cells. Helps digest food particles and release the nutrients to the cells.
Vacuoles - found in plants, absorbs water, hydrolytic functions, contain pigments. 
Peroxisome - Detoxification, breakdown of fatty acids, convert hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.
Mitochondria - Powerhouse of the cell, site of cellular respiration or breakdown of foods to produce energy.
Chloroplasts - found in plants, converts sunlight into chemical energy (photosynthesis), and has an inner and outer compartment.
Cytoskeleton - Network of protein fibers. Structure that helps cells maintain their shape and internal organization and it also provides mechanical support that enables cells to carry out essential functions like division and movement.
Cilia - Composed of many microtubules, any and short.
Flagella - Composed of a few microtubules, few and long and is found in men for humans. (Sperm)
Extracellular matrix - Holds cells together in tissues, and protects and supports the cellular membrane.
Integrins -  membrane proteins. They connect to microfilaments of the cytoskeleton.
Cell junctions - interact with neighboring cells. 
Cell wall - not found in animal cells, only plant cells. Have cell junctions called plasmodesmata that serve in communication between cell.
.
Tight - Prevent leakage of cellular fluid.
anchoring - fasten cells into strong sheets.
gap - channels that allow molecules to flow between cells.
.
Actin Filaments - Form a band just beneath the plasma membrane that provides mechanical strength to the cell. 
Intermediate Filaments - They provide a supporting framework within the cell. 
Microtubules - straight hollow cylinders found in both animal and plant cells whose wall is made up of a ring of 13 protofilaments.
.
Thylakoids - interconnecting sacs. Stacks of them are called Grana.
Stroma - the thick fluid that resides in the inner membrane. It contains DNA, ribosomes, and enzymes.
Grana - Stacks of thylakoids together.
Lysosomes are formed when Enzymes and membranes are transferred to the golgi apparatus.
Tay-Sachs disease - Abnormal accumulation of lipids in brain cells due to malfunction of lysosomes.
Mitochondria use Proteins to convert nutrients to energy for the cell and body of the organism. ATP or adenosine triphosphate.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA.
All organelles in a eukaryotic cell are membrane bounded.
One side functions as a receiving dock while the other side functions as a shipping dock. (in and out)
The golgi  apparatus receives the substances from the endoplasmic reticulum.
Ribosomes are synthesized from the ribosomal ribonucleic acid or RNA and the amino acids.
Chromatins are long fibers of DNA and protein.
The nucleus is continuous with the nuclear envelope.
Chromosomes in the cell are found in the nucleus.
all cells come from preexisting cells and all living things are composed of cells.

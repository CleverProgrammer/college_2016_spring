# Chapter 2 Notes

### Terminology
---
Term | Definition
---- | ---------
Matter | Anything that occupies space and has mass
Element | Substance that cannot be broken down by ordinary chemical means
Compound | Combination of two or more different elements
Atom | Smallest unit of matter that can still retain the properties of an element. Each element consist of only one kind of Atom
Atomic Number | Number of protons
Mass Number | Number of protons and neutrons
Isotopes | Same number of protons but different number of neutrons. Examples:  <sup>12</sup> C, <sup>13</sup> C, <sup>14</sup> C
PET | positron emission tomography
Tracer | different isotopes of an element behave identically in chemical reactions but living cells cannot distinguish between isotopes of the same element can be used as **tracers** in medical diagnosis
Octet Rule | Atoms like to have full valence shells of eight electrons in its outermost electron shell to be most stable

- **<sup>14</sup><sub>6</sub> C** --> 6 Protons and 14-6 (8) neutrons.
- **Neutrons + Protons = Mass Number**
- **Mass** of a proton and neutron are almost identical whereas the electron is 1/2000 the mass of a proton

### Subatomic Particles
---
Term | Definition
---- | ---------
Proton | Positive charge, in nucleus of an atom
Neutron | Neutral charge, in nucleus of an atom
Electron | Negative charge, found outside of the nucleus in the electron cloud
- Negative charge of the electrons and the positive charge of the protons keep the electrons near the nucleus

### Elements
---
- There are 92 elements in nature
- 4 elements make up 96% of human body- C, H, N, O
- About 25 elements are essential to life
- Trace elements-essential but only in minute amounts --> Like zinc, copper, iodine --> Iodine is needed in the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones

### Isotopes
---
- Carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable and don't emit particles
- carbon-14 unstable and it emits particles

### Radioactive Isotopes
---
- Nucleus decays spontaneously, giving off particles and energy
- Different isotopes of an element behave identically in chemical reactions but living cells cannot distinguish between isotopes of the same element can be used as **tracers** in medical diagnosis
- Instrument involved is **PET**-positron-emission tomography which detects location of radioactive materials used for diagnosis of heart disorders, cancer, and in brain research

### Electrons
---
- Occurs in energy levels called electron shells
- Number of electrons in outermost energy level (shell) determines the chemical properties of an atom
- 1st energy level in any atom has a maximum of 2 electrons
- 2nd energy level in any atom has a maximum of 8 electrons
- 3rd energy level in any atom has a maximum of 8 electrons


### Valence Electrons
---
- In the A group of the periodic table, the group number tells how many valence electrons that atom has
- **Octet Rule** - Atoms like to have full valence shells of eight electrons
- Atoms may react with each other by sharing, donating, or receiving electrons
- Atoms mass of an element is the weighted average of the isotopes of the element

### Electron Energy Levels
---
Level | Max Electrons
----- | ------------
1 | 2 Electrons
2 | 8 Electrons
3 | 8 Electrons

### Ions and Ionic bonds
---
- Ionic bonds are attractions between ions of opposite charges
<ol>
    <li>
    Ions are charged particles that lose or gain electrons
    </li>
    <li> Ions transfer electrons </li>
    <li> Ionic bonds result from the transfer of electrons between ions of opposite charges
    </li>
</ol>
- Ionic compounds are composed of a metal and a non-metal in the transferring of electrons
- Sodium + chlorine form together to form a **IONIC BOND** called NaCl (Salt)
- **Positive net charge means that it has lost an electron**
- **Negative net charge means that it has gained an electron**
- Ionic bond is between a metal and non-metal
- **Ions transfer electrons**

### Covalent bonds
---
- Sharing of electrons
- Two or mote atoms held together by a covalent bond formed by a **non-metal** and a **non-metals**
- Molecules are 2 or more elements that share electrons and form covalent bonds
- Can form single, double, or triple bond

### Electronegativity
---
- Electronegativity is the attraction for shared electrons
- Atoms in a covalent bond compete for shared electrons
- Electrons shared equally is a non-polar covalent bond
- One element - O<sub>2</sub>
- Electrons shared unequally is a polar covalent bond- H<sub>2</sub>O
- 2 or more different elements
- Non-polar is one element
- Polar are two or more different elements

### Polar Molecules
---
- When one end of a molecule is slightly positive and one end slightly negative

- H<sub>2</sub>O is a water molecule

### Hydrogen Bonds (weak Bonds)
---
- Water
- Water is a polar molecule
- Has atoms with different electro-negativities
- Oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than hydrogen so the shared electrons spend more time near oxygen
- The oxygen thus has lightly negative charge and hydrogen has a slightly positive charge
- Water molecule is attracted by a water molecule

### Properties of Water
---
Term | Definition
--- | ------
Cohesion | Molecules of the same kind stick together
Adhesion | Clinging of one substance to another (2 kinds of molecules)
Surface tension | forming a film on the surface (hydrogen bonds gives water its high surface tension)
- Water can exist as a solid, liquid or goals
- Ice is less dense than liquid water (in ice bonds are stable; in liquid water bonds are unstable) and thus ice floats at 4 degrees celsius

### Water is the solvent of life
---
- Solution is a uniform mixture of 2 or more substances
- A substance is an element or compound
- Solvent does the dissolving
- Solute being dissolved
- Both solvent and solute make up a Solution
- Aqueous water is the solvent

### Water's hydrogen bonds moderate temperature
---
- Has a greater ability to resist temperature change
- Heat is energy and the movement of atoms and molecules in matter
- Temperature is the intensity of Heat
- Heat is released when hydrogen bonds form an heat must be absorbed to break hydrogen bonds

### Acids and bases
---
- In aqueous solutions H<sub>2</sub>O molecules break apart into ions; (H +) hydrogen ions, and (OH-) hydroxide ions
- More H+ it's an acid (compounds that release hydrogen ions to a solution)
- An increase in hydrogen ions means a decrease in pH scale units
- More hydroxyl ions than hydrogen ions means it's a base
**PH** - Potential for hydrogen (describes how acidic or basic a solution a solution is)
- pH for human blood is about 7.4
- 0.6 is acidic
- 7 is neutral
- 8-14 is basic
- Each pH unit represents a tenfold change in the concentration of hydrogen ions

### Buffers
---
- Minimizes changes in pH
- Accepts hydrogen ions when in excess
- Donates hydrogen ions when depleted

### Chemical reactions
---
- Making and breaking of chemical bonds
- Reactants - Beginning substances -- Before the arrow
- Products - Results of the reaction -- After the arrow
- 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> --> 2 H<sub>2</sub>O
- Hydrogen and oxygen are the reactants and water is the product

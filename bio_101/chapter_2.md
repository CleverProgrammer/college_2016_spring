# Chapter 2 Notes

### Terminology
---
Term | Definition
---- | ---------
Matter | Anything that occupies space and has mass
Element | Substance that cannot be broken down by ordinary chemical means
Compound | Combination of two or more different elements
Atom | Smallest unit of matter that can still retain the properties of an element. Each element consist of only one kind of Atom
Atomic Number | Number of protons
Mass Number | Number of protons and neutrons
Isotopes | Same number of protons but different number of neutrons. Examples:  <sup>12</sup> C, <sup>13</sup> C, <sup>14</sup> C
PET | positron emission tomography
Tracer | different isotopes of an element behave identically in chemical reactions but living cells cannot distinguish between isotopes of the same element can be used as **tracers** in medical diagnosis

- **<sup>14</sup><sub>6</sub> C** --> 6 Protons and 14-6 (8) neutrons.
- **Neutrons + Protons = Mass Number**
- **Mass** of a proton and neutron are almost identical whereas the electron is 1/2000 the mass of a proton

### Subatomic Particles
---
Term | Definition
---- | ---------
Proton | Positive charge, in nucleus of an atom
Neutron | Neutral charge, in nucleus of an atom
Electron | Negative charge, found outside of the nucleus in the electron cloud
- Negative charge of the electrons and the positive charge of the protons keep the electrons near the nucleus

### Elements
---
- There are 92 elements in nature
- 4 elements make up 96% of human body- C, H, N, O
- About 25 elements are essential to life
- Trace elements-essential but only in minute amounts --> Like zinc, copper, iodine --> Iodine is needed in the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones

### Isotopes
---
- Carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable and don't emit particles
- carbon-14 unstable and it emits particles

### Radioactive Isotopes
---
- Nucleus decays spontaneously, giving off particles and energy
- Different isotopes of an element behave identically in chemical reactions but living cells cannot distinguish between isotopes of the same element can be used as **tracers** in medical diagnosis
- Instrument involved is **PET**-positron-emission tomography which detects location of radioactive materials used for diagnosis of heart disorders, cancer, and in brain research

### Electrons
---
- Occurs in energy levels called electron shells
- Number of electrons in outermost energy level (shell) determines the chemical properties of an atom
- 1st energy level in any atom has a maximum of 2 electrons
- 2nd energy level in any atom has a maximum of 8 electrons
- 3rd energy level in any atom has a maximum of 8 electrons


### Valence Electrons
---
- In the A group of the periodic table, the group number tells how many valence electrons that atom has

### Electron Energy Levels
---
Level | Max Electrons
----- | ------------
1 | 2 Electrons
2 | 8 Electrons
3 | 8 Electrons

# Chapter 2 Study Guide
---
### Four most common elements found among living organisms
---
1. H (Hydrogen)
2. C (Carbon)
3. N (Nitrogen)
4. O (Oxygen)

### 3 Trace elements found in the human body
---
- I (Iodine)
- Fe (Iron)
- Cu (Copper)

### Define the following terms
---
Term | Definition
---- | ----------
Compound | Combination of two or more elements
Protons | Positively charged, found in nucleus
Neutrons | Neutral Charge, found in nucleus
Electrons | Negative charge, found outside of the nucleus in an electron cloud and have a negative charge
Electron Cloud | Probability density function. Electrons travel in an orbital and not in an orbit
Atomic Number | Number of Protons
Mass Number | Neutrons + Protons
Atomic Mass | Weighted average of the isotopes of an element. Approximately number of Neutrons + Protons + Electrons (But electrons weight 1/2000th of protons)
Isotope | Same number of protons but different number of neutrons. Examples:  <sup>12</sup> C, <sup>13</sup> C, <sup>14</sup> C
Radioactive Isotope | Nucleus decays spontaneously, giving off particles and energy
Ionic Compound | Composed of a metal and a non-metal
Ions | Charged particles that lose or gain electrons
Covalent Bonds | Two non-metals that share electrons
Electronegativity | Attraction for shared electrons
Polar Covalent Bond | Unequally shared electrons between the atoms
Non-Polar Covalent Bond | Equally shared electrons between the atoms
Hydrogen Bonds | Weak bond that is formed usually in water molecules
Adhesion | Clinging of one substance to another
Cohesion | Tendency of molecules of the same kind to stick together
pH | Potential for hydrogen which is just a logarithmic scale that helps identify whether something is acidic or basic
Reactants of a Chemical Reaction | Beginning substances that are usually before the arrow
Products of a Chemical Reaction | Resulting substances that are usually after the arrow

### Identify the following isotopes
---
Isotope | Type | # Mass | # Atomic | # Neutrons
------- | ---- | ------ | --------
<sup>12</sup><sub>6</sub>C | Carbon | 12 | 6 | 6
<sup>32</sup><sub>16</sub>S | Sulfur | 32 | 16 | 16

#### How are ionic compounds formed?
---
- They are formed because of positive and negative ions

#### How are covalent compounds formed?
---
- When two or more non-metals bond by sharing valence electrons

#### Why is a H2O Molecule Slightly Positive and Slightly Negative?
---
- It is a polar covalent bond. The reason it is slightly positive and slightly negative is because the oxygen is more electronegative than the hydrogen so the electrons spend more time with the oxygen element than the hydrogens causing a slightly negative charge in the oxygen and a slightly positive charge in the hydrogens

#### Distinguish between heat and temperature
---
Term | Definition
---- | ---------
Heat | energy and the movement of atoms and molecules in matter
Temperature | intensity of heat or the average heat of the molecules in a substance

#### What is a buffer and how does it affect the cell?
---
- It helps maintain a normal pH level in our body
- It accepts hydrogen ions when in excess
- It donates hydrogen ions when depleted (How does it donate when it has none?)

#### Give an example of a chemical reaction and label the reactants and the products
---
mg <sup>+2</sup> + F<sup>-1</sup> --> mgF<sub>2</sub>

#### What does pH stand for?
---
- Potential Hydrogen

#### What are the increments on a pH scale?
---
- It is a logarithmic scale that shows whether something is basic or acidic and increases by a factor of 10. So 5 and 7 are actually 100 times different than each other

#### What is a tracer??
---
- These elements are essential to life are required in very small quantities. Some trace elements are: Iodine, Zinc, Copper, Magnesium

#### Define the following
---
Term | Definition
---- | ---------
Solution | Liquid consisting of a uniform mixture of two or more substances
Solute | Substance that is dissolved
Solvent | Substance that is doing the dissolving
Aqueous | Aqueous solution is one in which the water is the solvent
Acid | A substance that donates hydrogen ions to solutions
Base | A substance that reduces the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution
Buffer | It helps balance the pH levels. It accepts hydrogen ions when in excess. It donates hydrogen ions when depleted

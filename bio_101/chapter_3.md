# Chapter 3 Notes
---
#### Organic compounds - Have Carbon
---
- By sharing electrons carbon can bond to 4 other atoms
- Methane, CH<sub>4</sub> is the simplest organic compound
- Molecules of only carbon and hydrogen are **hydrocarbons**

Term | Definition
---- | ---------
Hydrocarbons | Molecules of only carbon and hydrogen
Methane CH<sub>4</sub> | Simplest organic compound
Isomers | Same chemical formula but different structure (glucose, fructose, galactose)
micro-molecule | Small molecules
Polymer | Long molecule made up of monomers (building blocks)
**Dehydration Reaction** | Loss of water molecule to produce a larger molecule (synthesize)
**Hydrolysis** | Gaining of a water molecule to produce a smaller molecule
Mono-saccharide | Contains one saccharide molecule
Di-saccharide | contains two saccharide molecules
Poly-saccharide | contains many saccharide molecules

##### Functional Groups - Few chemical groups that indicate the functioning of the molecule
---
Functional Group | Formation
---------------- | ---------
Hydroxyl | OH -- Alcohol
Carbonyl | C=O, includes aldehyde and ketone
Carboxyl | COOH
Amino group | NH<sub>2</sub>
Phosphate group | OPO<sub>3</sub>
Methyl | CH<sub>3</sub>

- Glucose and galactose are isomers and are aldehydes
- Fructose, also an isomer and is a ketone

#### Four classes of molecules important to organisms
---
- Carbohydrates
- Proteins
- Lipids
- Nucleic acids
- These are known as **micromolecules**

- All biological reactions are catalyzed by enzymes (speeds up a chemical reaction without itself being altered)

### Carbohydrates
---
- Sugars and starches
- Monosaccharides (most end in "ose")
- Simple sugars - CH<sub>2</sub>O formula
    - glucose, fructose, galactose - C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
    - main fuels for cellular work

### Disaccharides - linkage of 2 monosaccharides
---
- C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>
    - Maltose - glucose & glucose (beer)
    - Sucrose - glucose & fructose (table sugar)
    - Lactose - glucose & galactose (milk sugar)

### Polysaccharides
---
- Polymers (many) (thousands) of monosaccharides
    - Macromolecules that function as storage or as structural compounds
        - starch - plants use for energy
        - Glycogen - found in animals used for energy (stored in the liver)
        - Cellulose - forms the supporting structure of plants
        - Chitin - exoskeletons of insects and crustaceans

#### Lipids
---
- Important for long term storage
- Contains twice as much energy as a Polysaccharide
- Water insolvable
- Hydrophobic - Water fearing

#### Fats
---
- **Fats** - 3 fatty acids and a glycerol => triglyceride
- Energy storage - fatty acids are hydrophobic and non-polar
- **Unsaturated fat** - double bonds found in the fatty acids, liquid fat
- **saturated fat** - no double bonds found in the fatty acids - solid fat

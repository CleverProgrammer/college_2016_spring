# Chapter 8 Notes
---
### Cell division can be used for reproduction of single cell orgranisms
  Can be used for:
  - Repair and replacement of cells
  - Sperm and egg peroduction
  - Sexual reproduction produces great variation amiong offspring
  - Cell reproduction is accomplished by cell divison
  - Ensures continuity of life forom generation to generation
  
### Asexual Reproduction
---
- Identical offspring
- Prokaryotes ( need only one parent)
  - Reproduce by binary fission
  - Circular DNA and associated proteins associated with the DNA
  
### Sexual Reproduction
---
- Eukaryotes
  - More complex than prokaryotes
  - Chromosomes
    - Linear contain 1000's of genes and attached proteins called histones
    - Chromatin
      - Chromosomes seen as long fibers. When the cell prepares to divide it will coil and become compact
      
- In divison chromatin become compact as chromosomes, chromosomes duplicate, resulting in sister chromatids, sister chromatids separate and now called chromosomes
- At the end of cell division chromosomes become chromatin

- At the end of cell division chromosomes become chromatin
- Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs)
- Before a cell divides it will duplicate its chromosomes and the result will be sister chromatids which contain identical genes
- The two chromatids are joined at the centromere
- When the cell divies the sister chromatids separate and now called chromosomes(2 of them) identical to that from which they started

### Cell Cycle
---
- Have a total number of about 60 trillion cells that need to be replaced. Thus cell division

- In mitosis the cell cycle is the time from one cell division to another
- Cell division of **NON-SEX CELLS**

### Phases of the cell cycle are:
---
- Interphase
  - Last about 90% of the total time for a cell cycle
    - **G1** - phase in which it increases its supply of proteins, increases the numbers of its orgranells, and increases in size
    - **S** - phase in which chromosomes replicates
      - Start with a single chromosome and end up with 2 sister chromatids
    - **G2** - Phase where you have growth and preparation for cell division
    - **M** - Phase (mitosis and cytokinesis)

### Mitosis
---
- Nucleus and its contents divide and form two daughter cells

### Cytokinesis
---
- When the cytoplasm divides into two

### Mitosis - 4 main stages or phases
  - **Prophase** - Chromatin coils, seen as chromosomes
  -  2 sister chromatids formed,
  -  Mitotic spindle begins to form as microtubules grow out of the centrosomes
  -  Centrosomes produce the mitotic spindle
    - Organize microtubule arrangements
    - Contain a pair of centrioles (no centrioles in plant cells)
    - Nucleoli disappears

### Prometaphase or prophase
---
- Kinetochores attach centromeres of the chromosomes to the spindle
- Nuclear envelope disappears

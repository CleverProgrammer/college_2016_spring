# Chapter 8 Notes
---
### Cell division can be used for reproduction of single cell orgranisms
  Can be used for:
  - Repair and replacement of cells
  - Sperm and egg peroduction
  - Sexual reproduction produces great variation amiong offspring
  - Cell reproduction is accomplished by cell divison
  - Ensures continuity of life forom generation to generation
  
### Asexual Reproduction
---
- Identical offspring
- Prokaryotes ( need only one parent)
  - Reproduce by binary fission
  - Circular DNA and associated proteins associated with the DNA
  
### Sexual Reproduction
---
- Eukaryotes
  - More complex than prokaryotes
  - Chromosomes
    - Linear contain 1000's of genes and attached proteins called histones
    - Chromatin
      - Chromosomes seen as long fibers. When the cell prepares to divide it will coil and become compact
      
- In divison chromatin become compact as chromosomes, chromosomes duplicate, resulting in sister chromatids, sister chromatids separate and now called chromosomes
- At the end of cell division chromosomes become chromatin

- At the end of cell division chromosomes become chromatin
- Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs)
- Before a cell divides it will duplicate its chromosomes and the result will be sister chromatids which contain identical genes

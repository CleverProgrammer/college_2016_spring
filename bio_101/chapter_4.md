# Chapter 4 Notes

#### Cell Membrane
---
- Composed of phospholipids with embedded and attached proteins
    - Fluid mosaic of lipids and proteins
- In animals cholesterol embedded in Membrane
    - Stabilizes the membranes at warmer temperatures
    - Keeps the membrane fluid at lower temperatures

#### Membrane Proteins
---
- Help maintain cell shape
- Serve as receptors for chemical messengers (hormones)
- Function as enzymes (biological catalyst)
- Glycoproteins function as cell to cell recognition (recognize foreign particles)
- Involved in selective permeability allowing some substances in and others out
- Non-polar hydrophobic molecules pass easily through the lipid bilayer
- Polar molecules and ions not soluble in lipids require transport
- Proteins to enter cell membrane

#### Integrins
---
- Proteins attach to cytoskeleton on inside and extracellular matrix on outside
- Gives membrane a strong framework

#### Types of diffusion
---
- Diffusion - Particles spread out evenly in available space

#### 3 Types of Passive forms of diffusion
---
- **Simple diffusion**, **osmosis**, **facilitated diffusion**
    - Does not require extra energy
    - Going with (down) the concentration gradient (going from higher concentration to a lesser concentration)
    - requires no extra energy
    - Examples, oxygen and carbon dioxide (simple diffusion)

- **Osmosis** - diffusion of water (water goes to where there is less water)
    - Water balance in the cells and their surroundings is crucial to organisms
    - **Tonicity** - ability of a cell to gain or lose water
    - **Isotonic** - concentration on both sides are the same (solvent and solute)
    - **Hypotoic** - Solute concentration lower outside of the cell (cell gains water lyses (lyses means breaks open))
    - **Hypertonic** - solute concentration greater outside of the cell (cell shrinks crenation)
    - **Osmoregulation** - Control of water balance

- **Facilitated Diffusion**
    - larger molecules that cannot diffuse easily across the membrane
    - Molecules need to be carried across (ex glucose)
    - Goes with (down) the concentration gradient
    - Requires transport proteins
        - The protein is specific for the substrate (sugars, amino acids, ions , water) (molecules being carried across)
    - **Aquaporin** - A protein channel for water
        - Form of passive diffusion, does not require extra energy

#### Active transport
---
- Goes against the concentration gradient
    - Lower to higher concentration
- Requires transport proteins and extra energy
- Ions - are carried across such as the sodium-potassium pump

#### Process to transport large molecules across membranes
---
Term | Definition
---- | ----------
Exocytosis | Exports materials from inside the cell through membrane vesicles (proteins of polysaccharides) to the outside of the cell
Endocytosis | Takes in materials from the outside into the cell through membrane vesicles to the inside of the cell

#### 3 Kinds of Endocytosis
---
Kind | Definition
---- | ---------
Phagocytosis | Cell eating, large
Pinocytosis | Cell drinking (fluids)
Receptor mediated endocytosis | Membrane indented to form a coated pit. Proteins pick up molecules from the surroundings, coated pit closes, forms a vesicle and carries the molecules into the cytoplasm

#### Enzymes - Biological catalyst
---
- Complex proteins produced by all living things
    - Chains of amino acids linked together (tertiary and quaternary structure)
- Lowers the activation energy - lowers the amount of energy required to get the reaction to occur
- In a lab heat may be added to substances to produce a desired product
- The temperature is increased
    - Living cells do not have this option so they produce enzymes to bring substrates together to produce a product
    - This is done without increasing the temperature
    - This is done by lowering the activation energy

# MISSING NOTES
- Microtubules - Shape and support the cell composed of tubulin

### Cell Junctions
---
    - Interact with neighboring cells
    - 3 types found in animal cells
        - Tight-prevent leakage of cellular fluid
        - Anchoring-fasten cells into strong sheets
        - Gap - channels that allow molecules to flow between cells

### Cell wall
---
- Not found in animal cells
- Found in plant cells
- Have cell junctions called plasmodesmata that serve in communication between cells

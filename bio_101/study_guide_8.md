# Chapter 8 Study Guide
---
- Asexual Reproduction- Identical offspring, requires one parent, reproduce by binary fission. 
- Sexual Reproduction- Eukaryotes, more complex than prokaryotes, contain chromosomes, 1000’s genes and attached proteins called histones.
- Prokaryotes reproduce by binary fission.
- Organisms that are prokaryotes have circular DNA.
- Chromosomes seen as long fibers. When the cell prepares to divide it will coil and become compact.
- In mitosis, cell cycle is the time from one cell division to another. These are NON-SEX CELLS.
.
- Interphase- Lasts about 90% of the total time for a cell cycle.
- M Phase- Mitosis and cytokinesis)
.
- Prophase- Kinetochords attach centromeres of the chromosomes to the spindle nuclear envelope disappears.
- Metaphase- Mitotic spindle fully formed, the centromeres located on equatorial plate, the kinetochores face opposite poles of the spindle.
- Anaphase- Centromeres of sister chromatids come apart, sister chromatids separate, daughter chromosomes move towards the opposite ends of the poles, spindles shorten and the cell elongates.
- Telophase- Reverse of prophase, nuclear envelope reforms, chromatin fibers uncoil, nucleolus reappears, and the mitotic spindle disappears.
- Cytokinesis in animal cells - Animals cleavage furrow forms that pinch the cell into 2 cells. The ring of microfilaments made of actin which contract and pushes the parent cell into 2 cells.
- Cytokinesis in plant cells - Grows outward and fuses with the plasma membrane which later results to 2 daughter cells.
- Anchorage dependence - There’s a requirement for both animal and plant cells where they need to have contact with a solid surface in order to divide.
- Density dependent inhibition - Cells multiply to form a single layer and usually stop when they touch one another. It is needed so an overgrowth of cells does not happen within the organism.
- Checkpoints in the cell cycle - These checkpoints in the cell cycle regulate the cycle. Signals to either stop or go and is controlled by proteins in the cell.
.
- M Checkpoint - (mitotic checkpoint)
- G1 Checkpoint - Allows entry into S phase which causes the cell to leave the cycle and enter the G0 phase.
- G0 Checkpoint - If the cell does not receive the signal to go ahead then it will stop dividing such as nerve and muscle cells. (Density dependent inhibition)
.
- Cancer - disease caused by uncontrolled division of cells.
- Tumor - abnormal mass of cells.
- Benign tumor - abnormal mass of normal cells that stay at the same place.
- Malignant tumor - mass of cancer cells that displaces normal tissue and spread to other locations. 
- Carcinomas - Cancers that originate in the external or internal coverings of the body such as skin and internal linings.
- Sarcomas - arise in tissues that support the body such as bone and muscle.
- Leukemia - Cancer of blood forming tissues.
- Sister Chromatids - refers to two identical chromatids formed by the replication of a single chromosome. Both copies joined together by a common centromere.
- Centromere - is the part of a chromosome that links sister chromatids. The spindle fibers attach to the centromere.
- Autosomes - are chromosomes that is not a sex chromosome. They appear in pairs whose members have the same form but are different from the other pairs in a diploid cell.
- Kinetochord - protein structure on chromatids where the spindle fibers attach during cell division to pull sister chromatids apart.
- Centrioles - small set of microtubules that are arranged in a specific way. If there’s a pair, they usually form 90 degree angles.
- 44 autosomes
- 2 sex chromosomes, they affect us by choosing our gender and certain qualities we receive from the parents.
 - Gametes - Sex cells, egg and sperm which have a single sex chromosome, X or Y.
- Diploid Cells - 2 homologous sets of chromosomes whose total number of chromosomes is 2N.
- Haploid cell - One set of chromosomes is N
- Fertilized Egg - Zygote, diploid, full set of chromosomes.
- Cell division of the reproductive organs, reduces the number of chromosomes from diploid to haploid.
- Prophase 1 - Occupies 90% of meiosis and contains chromatin coils.
- Metaphase 1 - Tetrads are aligned on the equatorial plate. Spindle microtubules are attached to kinetochords at the centromeres.
- Anaphase 1- Migration of the chromosomes towards the 2 poles of the cell where the tetrads split apart and each doubled chromosomes remain at their centromere.
- Telophase 1 - Chromosomes are at the poles, chromosomes are haploid but duplicated (Sister chromatids), nuclear envelope reforms, and the cytokinesis occurs.
- Meiosis 2- The second the divisions of the nucleus of eukaryotic cell during meiosis, and contains prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II.
- Chiasma - a point where paired chromosomes remain in contact during the first metaphase of meiosis and the crossing over and exchanging of genetic material happens with the strands.
- Karyotype - Display of an individual’s chromosomes arranged in pairs. The process is that mitosis is stopped at metaphase using the cells of lymphocytes.
- Nondisjunction - is a process where chromosomes fail to separate. This occurs in meiosis.
- Chromosome breakage - 
- Deletion - if a fragment of a chromosome is lost.
- Duplication - if a fragment of a chromosome joins to a sister chromatid or a homologous chromosome.
- Inversion - if a fragment attaches to the original chromosome but in reverse direction.
- Translocation - attachment of a fragment to a nonhomologous chromosome.

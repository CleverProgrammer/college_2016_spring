### Chapter 5 Notes
---
##### Substrate concentration - affects enzyme activity
---
- Substrate concentration will reach a maximum when the active sites are filled, increasing the substrate will not increase the rate of reaction

- Most enzymes require **cofactors** as sometimes other chemicals are needed for the reaction to occur
    - Organic compounds (usually vitamins) and cofactors such as zinc, copper, and iron
        - Called coenzymes
        - These are nonprotein helpers

- Reactions with enzymes are up to 10 billion times faster than those without enzymes. And can catalyze up to 50,000 molecules per second

##### Inhibition of Enzymes
---
- Inhibitors inhibit a reaction. Some substances that occupy the active site and prevent a substrate molecule from binding to them are called active site-directed or competitive if they compete with the substrate for the active site.
- Some which are non-competitive inhibitors that attach to other parts of the enzyme molecule and may distort its shape

#### Energy
---
- Cells transfer energy as they perform work
- Energy is the capacity to do work
- 2 kinds of energy

#### Energy and the cell
---
- Kinetic- energy of motion
- Potential - energy at rest
- Heat or thermal energy is kinetic energy in motion
- Light is kinetic energy

#### Thermodynamics is the study of energy transformation
---
- Two laws of energy transformations
    - First law of thermodynamics
        - Energy in the universe is constant
    - Second law of thermodynamics
        - Energy conversations increase the disorder of the universe
            - Entropy is the measure of disorder

- When you put ice into a hot cup of tea heat will flow from the hot tea to the cold ice and melt the ice. Then, once the energy in the cup is evenly distributed, the cooled tea would reach a maximum state of entropy. This situation represents a standard increase in disorder, believed to be perpetually occurring throughout the entire universe.

    - Chemical reactions either release or store energy
        - **Exergonic reactions** - release energy
        - **Endergonic reactions** - require an input of energy or store energy

#### ATP
---
- **Adenosine triphosphate - ATP**
    - Source of energy for the cells
        - Consists of
            - Nitrogenous base- adenine
            - Five carbon sugar - ribose
            - 3 phosphate groups

- Phosphorylation
    - Hydrolysis of ATP
    - Releases energy by transferring a phosphate group

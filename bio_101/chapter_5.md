#### Cell Membrane
---
- Composed of phospholipids with embedded and attached proteins
    - Fluid mosaic of lipids and proteins
- In animals cholesterol embedded in Membrane
    - Stabilizes the membranes at warmer temperatures
    - Keeps the membrane fluid at lower temperatures

#### Membrane Proteins
---
- Help maintain cell shape
- Serve as receptors for chemical messengers (hormones)
- Function as enzymes (biological catalyst)
- Glycoproteins function as cell to cell recognition (recognize foreign particles)
- Involved in selective permeability allowing some substances in and others out
- Non-polar hydrophobic molecules pass easily through the lipid bilayer
- Polar molecules and ions not soluble in lipids require transport
- Proteins to enter cell membrane

#### Integrins
---
- Proteins attach to cytoskeleton on inside and extracellular matrix on outside
- Gives membrane a strong framework

#### Types of diffusion
---
- Diffusion - Particles spread out evenly in available space

#### 3 Types of Passive forms of diffusion
---
- **Simple diffusion**, **osmosis**, **facilitated diffusion**
    - Does not require extra energy
    - Going with (down) the concentration gradient (going from higher concentration to a lesser concentration)
    - requires no extra energy
    - Examples, oxygen and carbon dioxide (simple diffusion)

- **Osmosis** - diffusion of water (water goes to where there is less water)
    - Water balance in the cells and their surroundings is crucial to organisms
    - **Tonicity** - ability of a cell to gain or lose water
    - **Isotonic** - concentration on both sides are the same (solvent and solute)
    - **Hypotoic** - Solute concentration lower outside of the cell (cell gains water lyses (lyses means breaks open))
    - **Hypertonic** - solute concentration greater outside of the cell (cell shrinks crenation)
    - **Osmoregulation** - Control of water balance

- **Facilitated Diffusion**
    - larger molecules that cannot diffuse easily across the membrane
    - Molecules need to be carried across (ex glucose)
    - Goes with (down) the concentration gradient
    - Requires transport proteins
        - The protein is specific for the substrate (sugars, amino acids, ions , water) (molecules being carried across)
    - **Aquaporin** - A protein channel for water
        - Form of passive diffusion, does not require extra energy

#### Active transport
---
- Goes against the concentration gradient
    - Lower to higher concentration
- Requires transport proteins and extra energy
- Ions - are carried across such as the sodium-potassium pump

#### Process to transport large molecules across membranes
---
Term | Definition
---- | ----------
Exocytosis | Exports materials from inside the cell through membrane vesicles (proteins of polysaccharides) to the outside of the cell
Endocytosis | Takes in materials from the outside into the cell through membrane vesicles to the inside of the cell

#### 3 Kinds of Endocytosis
---
Kind | Definition
---- | ---------
Phagocytosis | Cell eating, large
Pinocytosis | Cell drinking (fluids)
Receptor mediated endocytosis | Membrane indented to form a coated pit. Proteins pick up molecules from the surroundings, coated pit closes, forms a vesicle and carries the molecules into the cytoplasm

#### Enzymes - Biological catalyst
---
- Complex proteins produced by all living things
    - Chains of amino acids linked together (tertiary and quaternary structure)
- Lowers the activation energy - lowers the amount of energy required to get the reaction to occur
- In a lab heat may be added to substances to produce a desired product
- The temperature is increased
    - Living cells do not have this option so they produce enzymes to bring substrates together to produce a product
    - This is done without increasing the temperature
    - This is done by lowering the activation energy

##### Substrate concentration - affects enzyme activity
---
- Substrate concentration will reach a maximum when the active sites are filled, increasing the substrate will not increase the rate of reaction

- Most enzymes require **cofactors** as sometimes other chemicals are needed for the reaction to occur
    - Organic compounds (usually vitamins) and cofactors such as zinc, copper, and iron
        - Called coenzymes
        - These are nonprotein helpers

- Reactions with enzymes are up to 10 billion times faster than those without enzymes. And can catalyze up to 50,000 molecules per second

##### Inhibition of Enzymes
---
- Inhibitors inhibit a reaction. Some substances that occupy the active site and prevent a substrate molecule from binding to them are called active site-directed or competitive if they compete with the substrate for the active site.
- Some which are non-competitive inhibitors that attach to other parts of the enzyme molecule and may distort its shape

#### Energy
---
- Cells transfer energy as they perform work
- Energy is the capacity to do work
- 2 kinds of energy

#### Energy and the cell
---
- Kinetic- energy of motion
- Potential - energy at rest
- Heat or thermal energy is kinetic energy in motion
- Light is kinetic energy

#### Thermodynamics is the study of energy transformation
---
- Two laws of energy transformations
    - First law of thermodynamics
        - Energy in the universe is constant
    - Second law of thermodynamics
        - Energy conversations increase the disorder of the universe
            - Entropy is the measure of disorder

- When you put ice into a hot cup of tea heat will flow from the hot tea to the cold ice and melt the ice. Then, once the energy in the cup is evenly distributed, the cooled tea would reach a maximum state of entropy. This situation represents a standard increase in disorder, believed to be perpetually occurring throughout the entire universe.

    - Chemical reactions either release or store energy
        - **Exergonic reactions** - release energy
        - **Endergonic reactions** - require an input of energy or store energy

#### ATP
---
- **Adenosine triphosphate - ATP**
    - Source of energy for the cells
        - Consists of
            - Nitrogenous base- adenine
            - Five carbon sugar - ribose
            - 3 phosphate groups

- Phosphorylation
    - Hydrolysis of ATP
    - Releases energy by transferring a phosphate group

The formula for cell respiration is: C6H12O6 + 6O2 ---> 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP.
It s a reaction that breaks down carbohydrates and sugars so the energy within them could be used.
4 ATP molecules can be formed.
34%-40% of glucose is used and the remainder is released as heat. 60-66%
Redox Reactions - the movement of electrons from one molecule to another.
NAD + oxidized (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)   
Electron carrier or coenzyme
Becomes reduced to NADH
      -	FAD - oxidized (flavin adenine dinucleotide) 
Electron carrier 
Becomes reduced to FADH2      
NAD+ 
There is a net gain of 2 ATP’s.
Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm.
.
ATP’s are continually produced.
Reduces 2 NADs to 2 NADHs
.
2 pyruvates are formed.
 Level Phosphorylation (An enzyme transfers a phosphate group from a substrate molecule to ADP and ATP is formed)
 Decarboxylation or Pyruvate Oxidation:
A carboxyl group is removed and given off as CO2
Converts 2 pyruvates into 2 acetyl - coenzyme A
Produces 2 carbon dioxides 
Acetyl - coenzyme A enters the citric acid cycle
Reduces 2 NADs to 2 NADHs
Requires oxygen (aerobic)
 Occurs in the mitochondria.
CO2 and acetaldehyde.
 Oxalacetate - combines with acetyl - Co - A
2 FADs reduced to 2 FADH2s 
Produces 2 ATPs
Reduces 6 NADs to 6 NADHs
Substrate level phosphorylation ( An enzyme transfers a phosphate group from a substrate molecule to ADP and ATP is formed)
 The electrons pass from one to another down the electron transport chain and energy is released and captured for production of ATP
 Like decarboxylation, it also occurs in the mitochondria.
 Oxygen is the final electron acceptor while H2O is the final product.
An electron transport chain couples an electron donor with an electron acceptor. In chemiosmosis, concentration gradient in this process diffuses Hydrogen ions through ATP synthesis which combines ATPs.
An enzyme with the primary use of creating ATP.

Rotenone - used to kill insects and fish 
-  Interruption in electron transport chain 
Cyanide and carbon monoxide 
-  Interruption in electron transport chain 
Antibiotic oligomycin - used externally on fungal infections
-  Inhibits ATP synthase 
Dinitrophenol 
- Interrupts chemiosmosis 
 Process that enables cells to produce ATP without oxygen 
.
Glycolysis to fermentation 
- Anaerobic (Without oxygen)
- Lactic acid fermentation produces 2 ATPs
- Alcoholic fermentation - yeasts produces 2 ATPs 
Other sources besides glucose for cellular respiration to occur 
- Proteins 
- Amino acids can enter the citric - acid cycle
- Fats
- Glycerol can enter during decarboxylation

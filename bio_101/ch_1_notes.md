# Levels of Biological Organization
### Basic Terminology
----------------
**Biosphere** - All environments on Earth that support life (Whole earth) <br>
**Ecosystem** - All orgranisms living and non-living physical components in a particular area. (Land, ocean, etc) <br>
**Population** - All orgranisms inhabiting a particular ecosystem. Can only be one thing at a time like JUST HUMANS or JUST TREES or JUST SQUIRRELS etc. <br>
**Organism** - Anything that is living. <br>
**Orgran System** - muscular, lymphatic, respiratory, endocrine, skeletal, muscular, integumentary, immune, urinary, reproductive, circulatory. <br>
**Organs** - Liver, stomach, etc and they are composed of tissues that perform a specific function. <br>
**Tissues** - Groups of cells that perform a specific function. <br>
**Cells** - Functional unit of life. <br>
**Organelles** - Subcellular structures that perform a specific function. <br>
**Molecules** - Made up of atoms held together by chemical bonds. <br>
**Atoms** - Smallest unit of matter.

### Cells: Functional units of life
---------------
- Regulate its interval environment
- Take in and use energy
- Respond to its environment
- Develop and maintain a complex organization
- Give rise to new cells
- All cells have an enclosed membrane that regulates what goes into and out of a cell
- All cells use **DNA** as their genetic information

Here are two basic types of cells: <br>
**Prokaryotic** (All bacteria, one celled):
```
a) Do not have organelles with a membrane smaller than eukaryotic
b) No true nucleas (no membrane around it)
c) Have genetic material (DNA) in an area called the nucleoid
d) Some have a cellwall (animal cells do not have a cell wall)
```
**Eukaryotic** (All plants, animals, fungi, and protists):
```
a) Examples of protists are amoebas, euglena, etc.
b) Contain membrane-bounded organelles
c) True nucleus (have a membrane around it)
```

**Plants**
```
Produce their own food
Photosynthetic
```

**Consumers**
```
Eat plants and other animals
```

**Decomposers**
```
Recycle, changing complex matter into simpler mineral nutrients (bacteria)
```

### Order: The highly ordered structure of life
--------------------------------------------------
**Regulation** - Homeostasis, maintaining a constant internal environment, an ability to control an organism's internal environment within limits that sustain life. <br>
**Growth and Development** - Consistent growth and development controlled by inherited DNA <br>
**Energy processing** - The use of chemical energy to pwer an organism's activities and chemical activities <br>
**Response to the environment** - An ability to respond to environmental stimuli. <br>

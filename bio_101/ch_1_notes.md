# Levels of Biological Organization
### Basic Terminology
----------------
**Biosphere** - All environments on Earth that support life (Whole earth) <br>
**Ecosystem** - All orgranisms living and non-living physical components in a particular area. (Land, ocean, etc) <br>
**Population** - All orgranisms inhabiting a particular ecosystem. Can only be one thing at a time like JUST HUMANS or JUST TREES or JUST SQUIRRELS etc. <br>
**Organism** - Anything that is living. <br>
**Orgran System** - muscular, lymphatic, respiratory, endocrine, skeletal, muscular, integumentary, immune, urinary, reproductive, circulatory. <br>
**Organs** - Liver, stomach, etc and they are composed of tissues that perform a specific function. <br>
**Tissues** - Groups of cells that perform a specific function. <br>
**Cells** - Functional unit of life. <br>
**Organelles** - Subcellular structures that perform a specific function. <br>
**Molecules** - Made up of atoms held together by chemical bonds. <br>
**Atoms** - Smallest unit of matter.

### Cells: Functional units of life
---------------
- Regulate its interval environment
- Take in and use energy
- Respond to its environment
- Develop and maintain a complex organization
- Give rise to new cells
- All cells have an enclosed membrane that regulates what goes into and out of a cell
- All cells use **DNA** as their genetic information

Here are two basic types of cells: <br>
**Prokaryotic** (All bacteria, one celled):
```
a) Do not have organelles with a membrane smaller than eukaryotic
b) No true nucleas (no membrane around it)
c) Have genetic material (DNA) in an area called the nucleoid
d) Some have a cellwall (animal cells do not have a cell wall)
```
**Eukaryotic** (All plants, animals, fungi, and protists):
```
a) Examples of protists are amoebas, euglena, etc.
b) Contain membrane-bounded organelles
c) True nucleus (have a membrane around it)
```

**Plants**
```
Produce their own food
Photosynthetic
```

**Consumers**
```
Eat plants and other animals
```

**Decomposers**
```
Recycle, changing complex matter into simpler mineral nutrients (bacteria)
```

### Order: The highly ordered structure of life
--------------------------------------------------
**Regulation** - Homeostasis, maintaining a constant internal environment, an ability to control an organism's internal environment within limits that sustain life. <br>
**Growth and Development** - Consistent growth and development controlled by inherited DNA <br>
**Energy processing** - The use of chemical energy to pwer an organism's activities and chemical activities <br>
**Response to the environment** - An ability to respond to environmental stimuli. <br>
**Reproduction** - The ability of an organism to reproduce their own kind. <br>
**Evolutionary adaption** - Adaptations evolve over many generations as individuals with traits best suited to their environment. <br>

### Three domains of life
-------------------------
**Bacteria** - Unicellular, no true nucleus but nuclear material is in an area called the nucleoid, prokaryotic. <br>
**Archea** - Live in extreme environment--> Bacteria, prokaryote. <br>
**Eukarya** - Membrane bounded nucleus - eukaryote... Includes protists, fungi, plants, and animals <br>
Term | Definition
------ | ------ |
Discovery Science | Describes nature, uses inductive reasoning, from specific to general |
Hypothesis-Based Science | Uses educated guesses, deductive reasoning, from general to specific |
Science | it is a way of knwoing and used to solve everyday problems |
Experimental Group | Contains the variable that is being tested |
Control Group | Same as experimental but no variable is being tested |
Independent Variable | What I can change. Like the intensity of the light and so on. This will always be the X-axis.
Dependent Variable | What I observe
Controlled Variable | What stays constant in all experiments

- Science uses **inductive** reasoning to draw conclusions from many observations
- Science uses **deductive** reasoning to come up with ways to test a hypothesis (A proposed explanation for a set of observations)
- Proven hypothesis can become a theory

### Scientific Method
--------------------
1. Determine the question or problem
2. Develop the hypothesis:
	Involves researching the problem
	Find what others have learned
	Use that informatino to help devise an answer
	Should answer the original question and should be **TESTABLE**
3. Design an experiment to test the hypothesis
	results either support or disprove the hypothesis
	hypothesis is said to be **supported**
4. At least 2 groups in the experiment
	First group is the experimental group and has the factor or variable beng tested
	Second group is the control group, identical to the experimental group except does not contain the experimental variable.
5. Conduct the experiment to collect the data
	Will be measuring the dependent variable (this is what is being observed or measured)
6. Draw conclusions from your data
	If hypothesis is supported then it can be repeated
	If hypothesis is supported by many experiments and a lot of data then it is a **theory**
7. **Independent Variable** - Can be changed
   **Dependent Variable** - Values that result from independent variable

hapter 5 Study Guide
---
##### What is a cell membrane made up of?
---
- Composed of phospholipids with embedded and attached proteins
  - Fluid mosaic of lipids and proteins
  
##### Where is cholesterol found in animals?
---
- Cholestrol is found in membranes of animals

##### Name 5 functions of membrane proteins.
---
- a.) Help maintain cell shape

- b.) Serve as receptors for chemical messengers (hormones)

- c.) Function as enzymes (biological catalyst)

- d.) Glycoproteins function as cell to cell recognition (recognize foreign particles)

- e.) Proteins to enter cell membrane

##### What passes through easily through the lipid bilayer?
---
- Non-polar hydrophobic molecules

##### Which molecules are not soluble in lipids and require transport proteins?
---
- Polar molecules and ions not soluble in lipids require transport

##### What are integrins?
---
- Proteins attach to cytoskeleton on inside and extracellular matrix on outside
- Gives membrane a strong framework

##### What is the phospholipid bilayer made up of?
---
- The lipid bilayer is a thin polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells.

##### Which are the passive forms of diffusion?
---
- Simple diffusion
- Osmosis
- facilitated diffusion

##### Define diffusion
---
- Particles spread out evenly in available space

##### Define the following
---
- Osmosis- diffusion of water (water goes to where there is less water)

- Tonicity- ability of a cell to gain or lose water

- Isotonic- concentration on both sides are the same (solvent and solute)

- Hypotonic- Solute concentration lower outside of the cell (cell gains water lyses (lyses means breaks open))

- Hypertonic- Solute concentration greater outside of the cell (cell shrinks crenation)

- Osmoregulation- Control of water balance

##### What is facilitated diffusion?
---
- process of spontaneous passive transport (as opposed to active transport) of molecules or ions across a biological membrane via specific transmembrane integral proteins.

##### What is needed for facilitated diffusion?
---
- Requires transport proteins
  - The protein is specific for the substrate (sugars, amino acids, ions , water) (molecules being carried across)
  
##### What is an aquaporin?
--- 
- A protein channel for water
  - Form of passive diffusion, does not require extra energy
  
##### What is active transport?
---
- uses energy to move substances against (up) a concentration gradient or across a partially permeable membrane
- Goes against the concentration gradient
  - Lower to higher concentration
- Requires transport proteins and extra energy
- Ions - are carried across such as the sodium-potassium pump

#### #What is required for active transport to occur?
---
- Requires transport proteins and extra energy

##### How are ions carried across the membrane?
---
- Channel proteins are transport proteins that move ions across the cell membrane with a chemical gradient or electrical potential

##### Define the following:
---
- Exocytosis - Exports materials from inside the cell through membrane vesicles (proteins of polysaccharides) to the outside of the cell

- Endocytosis - Takes in materials from the outside into the cell through membrane vesicles to the inside of the cell

- Phagocytosis - Cell eating, large

- Pinocytes - Cell drinking (fluids)

- Receptor-mediated endocytosis - Membrane indented to form a coated pit. Proteins pick up molecules from the surroundings, coated pit closes, forms a vesicle and carries the molecules into the cytoplasm

##### What are enzymes?
---
- Complex proteins produced by all living things
  - Chains of amino acids linked together (tertiary and quaternary structure)

##### What do enzymes do in the cell?
---
- Lowers the activation energy - lowers the amount of energy required to get the reaction to occur

##### Most enzymes end in____________
---
- Most enzymes end in -ase like lipase (substrate is lipids) and lactase (substrate is lactose)

##### What is the enzymes active site?
---
- Typically a pocket or groove on the surface of the enzyme

##### Where does the substrate fit into the enzyme?
---
- Called the induced fit model because the enzyme is induced to undergo a slight alteration for the substrate to fit.

##### What does it mean when we say enzymes are specific?
---
- A few enzymes exhibit absolute specificity; that is, they will catalyze only one particular reaction. Other enzymes will be specific for a particular type of chemical bond or functional group

##### How many times can an enzyme be used?
---
- It can be used many times

##### What is the modern model of an enzyme called?
---

##### What happens when the substrate enters the active site?
---
- As the substrate enters the active site, the enzyme changes shape slightly due to interactions between the substrate's chemical groups and chemical groups on the side chains of the amino acids that form the active site. 
- This shape change makes the active site fit even more snugly around the substrate. This induced fit is like a clasping handshake. Induced fit brings chemical groups of the active site into positions that enhance their ability to catalyze the chemical reaction.

##### What happens to the enzyme once the product is formed?
---
- When the enzyme and substrate are joined, the catalytic action of the enzyme converts the substrate to the product (or products) of the reaction. 

- For example, the enzyme sucrase (most enzymes names end in "ase") catalyzes the hydrolysis of the disaccharide sucrose into its products, two monosaccharides, glucose and fructose. 

- The reaction catalyzed by each enzyme is very specific; an enzyme can recognize its specific substrate even among closely related compounds.

##### What is energy?
---
- Energy is the capacity to do work

##### What are the 2 kinds of energy?
---
- 1. Kinetic
- 2. Potential

##### What are the 2 laws of energy transformations?
---
- a.) First law of thermodynamics
  - Energy in the universe is constant

- b.) Second law of thermodynamics
  - Energy conversations increase the disorder of the universe
    - Entropy is the measure of disorder

##### What is the difference between exergonic and endergonic reactions?
---
- Exergonic reactions - release energy
- Endergonic reactions - require an input of energy or store energy

##### What do the letters of ATP stand for?
---
- Adenosine triphosphate

##### What does ATP consist of?
--- 
- a.) Nitrogenous base - adenine

- b.) Five carbon sugar - ribose

- c.) 3 phosphate groups

##### What is phosphorylation?
---
- Hydrolysis of ATP
- Releases energy by transferring a phosphate group

##### Define The Following Terms:
---
- Selectively permeable - A selectively permeable cell membrane is one that allows certain molecules or ions to pass through it by means of active or passive transport
- Turgor - pressure is the pressure of water pushing the plasma membrane against the cell wall of a plant cell
- Plasmolysis - pressure decreases to the point where the protoplasm of the cell peels away from the cell wall, leaving gaps between the cell wall and the membrane and making the plant cell flaccid

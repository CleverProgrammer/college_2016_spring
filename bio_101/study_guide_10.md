# Chapter 10 Study Guide
---

- Frederick Griffith studied bacteria that caused pneumonia. He found that there were 2 strains. One was pathogenic and the other was not.
.
- Used Bacteriophages or viruses. They found that viruses contained DNA and proteins.
- They used phosphorus and sulfur because there was no phosphorus found in a protein and no sulfur found in DNA.
- Bacteriophage is another term for a “Virus”
- Chargaff discovered the amount of thymine found was always equal to the amount of adenine and the amount of cytosine was always the same amount as the amount of guanine.
.
- Sugar (deoxyribose)
- Phosphate (1 phosphorus atom joined with 4 oxygen atoms)
- One of 4 bases (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine)
.
- Deoxyribose - Five Carbon sugar in DNA
- Ribose - Five Carbon sugar in RNA
.
- Nitrogenous Bases found in DNA: Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine
- Nitrogenous Bases found in RNA: Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Uracil
.
- Complementary Bases Found in DNA - A = T, G = C
- Complementary Bases Found in RNA - A = U, G = C
.
- Pyrimidine Bases - DNA  A = T Pairs up with G = C
- Purine Bases - RNA  A = U instead of A = T
.
- Purine - “Pure as Silver (AG)” Adenine and Guanine have double bonds.
- Pyrimidines - has to be paired with Purine. (C U T)
- 2 double bonds are formed between the base pairs.
- A Template is an original strand used to make a new DNA molecule.
- A template is used to make a DNA molecule and the enzyme or “helicase” unwinds the DNA molecule.
- It’s a process that declares a replication of DNA
- The part of the replication when the two strands of the double helix separate.
- When each strand or each fork join another fork to make a replication bubble.
- The DNA polymerase is the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis to make a new DNA strand.
- 5’ to 3’
- The nitrogenous bases are paired up in one certain way and vice versa.
- Leading strands is synthesized continuously while the okazaki strand synthesized discontinuously.
- The DNA ligase closes the gaps in the backbone of the DNA.
- A primer is a strand of short nucleic acid sequences.The enzymes in the primer are the catalyst for the process.
- Helicases are used to separate the strands of a DNA double helix.
- Transcription - Transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA
- Translation - 	Transfer of information in RNA to a protein.
.
- Transcription
- Occurs in nucleus.
- Makes genetic messages in the form of RNA
- Attaches to the RNA polymerase.
- Protect mRNA from the enzyme.
- Translation
- Occurs in the surface of the ribosome or in the cytoplasm.
- Process in which ribosomes create protein. 
- mRNA produced by transcription in DNA is decoded to make a specific amino acid.
- Is what is being produced in the end of the process.
- The DNA polymerase is what catalyzes in transcription.
- Is a site on a DNA where the enzyme in RNA can initiate transcription of DNA into RNA.
- 5’ cap to 3’, then they splice, then released by the polymerase, and then leaves.
 - .
- Exons- code for proteins.
- Introns- are intervening sequences.
- .
- Codon- three-based sequence in mRNA.
- Anticodon- three-based sequence in tRNA.
 - The genetic code is the nucleotide triplets of DNA and RNA molecules that carry genetic information in living cells.
- .
- Start codon (AUG) marks the start of an mRNA message.
- tRNA leaves, another enters and polypeptide (protein) elongates until you have the stop codon.(UAA, UAG, UGA ⇐ the 3 stop codons)
 - The ribosome has 2 subunits, one small and one large. The small one reads the RNA message while the large one attaches to the amino acid to form a polypeptide chain.
- . A-site is the ribosomal site occupied by the aminoacyl-tRNA. P-site is the ribosomal site occupied by the peptidyl-tRNA.
 - 3 stages of translation
- Initiation
- Start codon (AUG) marks the start of an mRNA message
- mRNA binds to small subunit of the ribosome.
- tRNA binds to start codon (Methionine) (AUG) (on mRNA)
- Large subunit binds to small subunit
- tRNA (With its amino acid attached) fits into P site (tRNA binding site) and other binding site, A site, awaits another tRNA with amino acids being added one at a time.
- Elongation
- Adds amino acids to the polypeptide chain.
- Anticodon pairs (tRNA) with codon (mRNA)
- Peptide bond formation translocation (termination)~
- Translocation (termination)
- tRNA leaves, another enters and polypeptide (protein) elongates until you have the stop codon.(UAA, UAG, UGA ⇐ the 3 stop codons)
- There is a polypeptide from last tRNA and leaves the ribosome.
- Ribosome splits back into its separate subunits
- There is one tRNA for each specific amino acid.
- Lytic cycle for bacterias happen where the viral particles are produced by the host’s cell parts. They begin to undergo destruction of cells and are later released.
- The lysogenic cycle works where the viral DNA is inserted in the host's chromosomes. The viral DNA is replicated to the host’s chromosomes and remain inactive. Environment changes can change the cycle from lysogenic to lytic.
- Reverse transcriptase produces DNA from RNA.Viruses that contain these are retroviruses because they are RNA viruses.
- .
- Viroids- Small circular RNA molecules that infect plants
- Prions- Infectious proteins. Cause degenerative brain diseases in animals.
- A prophage is the genetic material of a bacteriophage, incorporated into the genome of a bacterium and able to produce phages if specifically activated.

Term | Definition
------ | ------ |
Discovery Science | Describes nature, uses inductive reasoning, from specific to general |
Hypothesis-Based Science | Uses educated guesses, deductive reasoning, from general to specific |
Science | it is a way of knwoing and used to solve everyday problems |
Experimental Group | Contains the variable that is being tested |
Control Group | Same as experimental but no variable is being tested |
Independent Variable | What I can change. Like the intensity of the light and so on. This will always be the X-axis.
Dependent Variable | What I observe
Controlled Variable | What stays constant in all experiments

- Science uses **inductive** reasoning to draw conclusions from many observations
- Science uses **deductive** reasoning to come up with ways to test a hypothesis (A proposed explanation for a set of observations)
- Proven hypothesis can become a theory

### Scientific Method
--------------------
1. Determine the question or problem
2. Develop the hypothesis:
	Involves researching the problem
	Find what others have learned
	Use that informatino to help devise an answer
	Should answer the original question and should be **TESTABLE**
3. Design an experiment to test the hypothesis
	results either support or disprove the hypothesis
	hypothesis is said to be **supported**
4. At least 2 groups in the experiment
	First group is the experimental group and has the factor or variable beng tested
	Second group is the control group, identical to the experimental group except does not contain the experimental variable.
5. Conduct the experiment to collect the data
	Will be measuring the dependent variable (this is what is being observed or measured)
6. Draw conclusions from your data
	If hypothesis is supported then it can be repeated
	If hypothesis is supported by many experiments and a lot of data then it is a **theory**
7. **Independent Variable** - Can be changed
   **Dependent Variable** - Values that result from independent variable

# Three Fundamental Principles of Power
--------------------------------------
### Power of Politics
-------------------
- Power: The ability of governments and leaders to make and enforce rules, influence behavior of citizens
- Power can be "hard" in form of brute corecion (like war) or "soft" through personal attraction or persuasion.
- Power can result from rewards/punishments, as well as from authority. Authority, in turn, may have three sources:

###### Max Weber's Three Types of Authority:
```
a) traditional: Based on a system in which authority is legitimate because it
   "has always existed". People in power usually enjoy it because they have inherited it.

b) charismatic: Based on the charisma of the leader, who shows that he
   possesses the right to lead by virtue of magical powers, prophecies, heroism, etc
   
c) legal: Based on a system of rules that is applied administratively 
   and judicially in accordance with known principles. The persons who administer 
   those rules are appointed or elected by legal procedures.
```
###### Power has three concepts:
``` 
1) Power as influence
2) Power as Capabilities
3) Coercive versus Non-coercive Power: Section stresses that power can result from 
   rewards/punishments as well as from authority.
```
###### Power as Influence:
```
a) Getting people to do what you want them to do
b) Overcoming resistance
```
###### Power as Capabilities:
```
a) Government office, money, control of military, etc. These things allow one to have influence.

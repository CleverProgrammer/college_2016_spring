#### Theater as Art
-----------------------------
- **Lifelikeness**: How realistic it is
- **Ephemerality**: You are experiencing things in the moment.
- **Objectivity**: Seeing more than one perspective.
- **Complexity of Means**: Sending a message through a median like the music, lights, stage, etc.
- **Immediacy**: Based on ephemerality. It is a live experience. Like a live music show. You do not get this with movies or TV.
